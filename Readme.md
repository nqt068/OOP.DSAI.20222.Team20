## Description

The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is designed to help users understand the inner workings of sorting algorithms by providing a visual representation of the sorting process. Users can input an array of numbers, select a sorting algorithm, and observe the step-by-step execution of the algorithm on the array.

## Project Structure

The project repository consists of the following folders:

- **design**: Contains design diagrams, including the general class diagram, use case diagram, and other package class diagrams.
- **Image_resources**: Contains image resources used in the application, such as icons and images.
- **demo**: Contains a demo video showcasing the functionality of the Sorting Algorithm Visualization Tool.
- **presentation**: Contains the pptx file for the presentation.
- **report**: Contains the report paper for the project.
- **sourcecode**: Contains the source code files of the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer.

## Installation
To use the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer, you need to clone the project repository from GitHub:

``` git clone https://github.com/nqt068/OOP.DSAI.20222.Team20.git ```

## Usage

To run the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer, follow these steps:

1. Open the `App.java` file located in the `sourcecode` folder.
2. The application will start, and you will be presented with a user interface on the home screen where you can select a sorting algorithm.
3. Once you have selected a sorting algorithm, the sorting screen will appear.
4. You have two options for inputting an array:
   - Manually input an array by entering values in the provided input fields.
   - Generate a random array by clicking the "Create (A)" button.
5. After inputting the array, click the "Sort" button to start the visualization.
